Can big data improve public policy analysis? 
ABSTRACT We conduct a systematic review targeting the idea of whether big data can improve public policy analysis. The ideas about the benefits and risks of applying big data technologies on public policy analysis are summarized. Big data can provide accurate, proactive, and participatory policy analysis but at the same time it raises risks in data privacy, data misuse and bias, and inequality. We then examine the detailed implementation of big data in each public policy stage. The experiments or practical applications from the relevant literature demonstrate how exactly big data is used to improve policy analysis. This study will guide governments on adopting big data for public policy analysis

Problem Formulation and Fairness
Formulating data science problems is an uncertain and difficult process. It requires various forms of discretionary work to translate high-level objectives or strategic goals into tractable problems, necessitating, among other things, the identification of appropriate target variables and proxies. While these choices are rarely self-evident, normative assessments of data science projects often take them for granted, even though different translations can raise profoundly different ethical concerns. Whether we consider a data science project fair often has as much to do with the formulation of the problem as any property of the resulting model. Building on six months of ethnographic fieldwork with a corporate data science team---and channeling ideas from sociology and history of science, critical data studies, and early writing on knowledge discovery in databases---we describe the complex set of actors and activities involved in problem formulation. Our research demonstrates that the specification and operationalization of the problem are always negotiated and elastic, and rarely worked out with explicit normative considerations in mind. In so doing, we show that careful accounts of everyday data science work can help us better understand how and why data science problems are posed in certain ways---and why specific formulations prevail in practice, even in the face of what might seem like normatively preferable alternatives. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings, arguing that effective normative interventions will require attending to the practical work of problem formulation.
