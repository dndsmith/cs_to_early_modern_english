CUhackit 19 project. Translate computer science academic documents into early modern english

This project attempts to convert Modern English to Early Modern English (Shakespearean language). This project helps people lighten up the mood when they are trying to read academic documents (or any other documents).
It accounts for certain key words and phrases and changes them to the equivalent ones in Early Modern English.
Additionally, it replaces programming terms that wouldn't exist when the dialect was spoken.
We utilized python program to replace these buzzwords while using AWS polly to read out the converted document. In addition, we also used Amazon EC2, S3, VPC, and attempted to use Amazon Translate and Comprehend for foreign documents.
