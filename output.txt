Artificial Intelligence AI is a herculean field , as well as this is a herculean book . We hath tried to explore the full breadth o' the field , which encompasses logic , probability , as well as continuous mathematics ; perception , reasoning , acquisition , as well as action ; as well as everything from microelectronic devices to robotic planetary explorers . The book is also herculean because we go into some depth . The subtitle o' this book is A Modern Approach . '' The intended meaning o' this rather empty phrase is that we hath tried to synthesize what is now known into a common framework , rather than trying to explain each subfield o' AI in its own historical context . We apologize to those whose subfields art , as a result , less recognizable .
